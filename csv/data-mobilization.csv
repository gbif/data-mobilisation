To combat this problem the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources along with multiple organizations have instituted a biological control program. These agents when released in sufficient numbers will suppress spotted knapweed populations. To aid in the systematic control of spotted knapweed populations statewide a roadside release program will be start in 2011. This program targets existing SK populations along roadsides which have had been previously mapped. To further the effectiveness of this program additional roadways in Wisconsin will need to be mapped. To accomplish this task “survey boxes” are being distributed to interested volunteers across the state. The objective is to locate and “mark” (with GPS) existing spotted knapweed populations along roadsides. This data will then be downloaded into the Wisconsin DNR spotted knapweed database and then distributed to the CitSci.org website (Wisconsin Spotted Knapweed Roadside Project).;North America;;http://www.citsci.org/cwis438/Browse/Project/Project_Info.php?ProjectID=311;kcopas;#REF!Wondo Genet Plant Inventory 2013;Map species occurrences of the plants of Wondo-Genet College of Forestry.
